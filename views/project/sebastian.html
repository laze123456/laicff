			<hr>
			<p class="text-black"> Sebastian is an 8-year old boy who lives with his grandmother in an ordinary house in an ordinary, monochrome world. But when Sebastian gets on the bike to go for a ride, the adventure into his imagination begins. Mesmerized by the transformation of the colorless city Sebastian crosses the street without paying attention. A car hits him, but only his bike is damaged. After the accident, Sebastian has vivid dreams re-experiencing his birth and entering a fairytale world. When the girl and her mother return the fixed bike, the girl gives Sebastian her magnifying glass. Through this glass everything appears in color, except the newspaper. The kids set the newspaper on fire and run away from the inescapable realities of the adult existence.
