				<p class="text-black"> Puja Maewal is an Indian American writer/director. She has a B.A. in English from Yale University and an MFA in Film Directing from UCLA. She has been a Jury Award Winner at the Directors Guild of America Student Awards, a CINE Golden Eagle Winner, and a two-time Student BAFTA/LA Finalist. In addition, her work has been recognized by the Motion Picture Association of America and the Caucus for Producers, Writers & Directors Foundation. Her films have screened at numerous international festivals, including Comic-Con, Kolkata International Film Festival, and LA Shorts Fest. Puja has also developed content for several production companies, including BBC Worldwide. While at UCLA, she received a Fulbright Grant to study filmmaking in India, where she shot her MFA thesis film, JAYA, a Semi-finalist in the Student Academy Awards and the “Best Film” Winner at UCLA Directors Spotlight, the film school's highest honor. Most recently, she was selected to take part in the Directors Guild of America's Asian American Directing Mentorship Program. She is currently writing the feature-length version of JAYA, and her script was a Semi-finalist in the Nantucket Screenwriters Colony and Quarter-finalist in the BlueCat Screenplay Competition; Puja hopes to return to Mumbai to shoot it.</p>
				<h3 class="text-primary"> PRODUCTION NOTES </h3>
				<p class="text-black"> Young Jaya survives brutal gang life on Mumbai's unforgiving streets by posing as a boy. When she encounters a wealthy businessman who may be the father who abandoned her, she sets out to reclaim her identity.</p>
				<p class="text-black"> I was inspired to tell this story when I came across a compelling newspaper article while on a Fulbright grant in India. The article detailed the arrest of a notorious member of an Indian street gang, who was wanted in over a hundred cases of purse and jewelry snatchings. The police assumed they had caught a boy, because the teenage suspect dressed and acted like a typical Indian boy. But it was only after several hours of intense interrogation that they realized they had actually captured a girl. She had been forced to masquerade as a boy for safety reasons, yet still she could not avoid horrific acts of sexual assault. </p>
				<p class="text-black"> Though movies about street children have been done before, we have never seen a film from the perspective of a Mumbai street girl, which is why I wrote JAYA. I was drawn to this story because I wanted to feature a female protagonist who is both aggressive and vulnerable, a combination that I don't often see in female characters onscreen. I also wanted to explore the relationship between a teenage girl and the father who abandoned her; I was particularly interested in how someone comes to terms with those feelings of abandonment.</p>
				<p class="text-black"> Finding the lead actress was probably one of the most difficult obstacles we faced, as we auditioned hundreds of girls for the role, but almost all of them refused to cut their hair in the boy cut that the role requires. Luckily, Faimida Shaikh, the girl we finally chose, wore a hijab on a daily basis, and so she was fine with cutting off her hair--since no one would be able to tell the difference. In order to learn to pass as a boy, she studied and mimicked her elder brother’s behavior, an exciting task, since her mother had stressed the importance of domestic duties only, to prepare Faimida for an arranged marriage at age eighteen.</p>
				<p class="text-black"> I hope you enjoy the film. I fell in love with Mumbai while making it, and I want to show others why the city’s energy, diversity, and spirit captivate me. I also want to present to the world the tireless efforts of my cast and crew, who put their hearts and souls into this movie. JAYA is my UCLA Thesis Film, and so far, it has been a Semifinalist in the Student Academy Awards, a Jury Award Winner at the Directors Guild of America Student Awards, a CINE Golden Eagle Winner, and a BAFTA/LA Finalist. We would love to screen the film in cities across the world.</p>
