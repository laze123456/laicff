				<h3 class="text-primary"> DIRECTOR:  Erica Watson </h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="text-black"> Erica A. Watson is a recent graduate of the MFA program at USC's School of Cinematic Arts. Erica began her journey as an artist at the age of seven, when she first began studying the piano in her hometown of Detroit, Michigan. She wrote her first short screenplay at the age of ten, as part of a middle school Creative Video class. At the age of fourteen, she enrolled in the legendary Cass Technical High School, following in the footsteps of Diana Ross, David Alan Grier, Lily Tomlin, and Donald Byrd. It was here that she advanced her skills as a pianist and become a music major. It was also in high school that she began studying the harp and became a member of the Cass Tech Harp and Vocal Ensemble. In 2006, Erica continued her journey as a musician and filmmaker at Wayne State University. There she served as a harpist in the WSU Symphony Orchestra, Concert Band, Wind Symphony, Harp Ensemble, and Wind Ensemble. 
				</p>


				<p class="text-black"> Erica established a Detroit based film production company with cinematographer, Alesyn McCall called Hyphenation Nation Productions, which produced ten short films between 2007 and 2010. Her directorial debut, "SLAM" (2007) was featured in the 2009 Short Film Corner at the 62nd Annual Cannes Film Festival. Her films, "Brothers" and "The Majestic Palm" were also featured in subsequent editions of the Short Film Corner. She attended the Cannes Film Festival for the fifth consecutive year in May 2013, with her short film, &quot;Embryo." She is also the producer of "Conversation in Cannes", a web based interview series that features Black filmmakers who attend the festival and chronicles the advice that they offer to those who aspire to attend. Additionally, her work has been featured in the WSU Moving Media Student Showcase, the Michigan Film Awards, Detroit Docs International Film Festival, Detroit Independent Film Festival, and Campus Movie Fest Student Filmmaker Competition. She has directed a total of 13 short films and 4 episodes of the "Conversations in Cannes" interview series. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-black"> While at Wayne State University, she was the creator of the "Show Your Love Concert Series", a talent showcase for local Detroit musicians and poets and the "Spike Lee-A-Thon", a 3 day Black History Movie Marathon honoring Spike Lee. She worked as a Success Coach for WSU's Academic Success Center and as a featured writer for "The South End". During the Fall of 2010, she completed her Pre-Student teaching at Spain Elementary / Middle School in Detroit, establishing the school's first beginning harp program. In 2011, she earned a Bachelor of Music from Wayne State University, with a concentration in Instrumental Music Education and a minor in Film.

				<h3 class="text-primary"> CINEMATOGRAPHER/DP: Tommy Maddox Upshaw </h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="text-black"> Tommy “Maddox”-Upshaw’s artistic endeavors began in Worcester, Massachusetts while attending The College of the Holy Cross, shooting black and white stills as well as student video projects, considering there was no film department. He is a reactionary artist who grow up in the inner-city of Boston while experiencing an education far from where he called home, outside the Boston area.  </p>

				<p class="text-black"> His professional career in the film industry started between his hometown of Boston and New York City as a production assistant at the age of 18. Once on set picking up trash and fetching coffee, he realized he was in the right place. The collaborative role of the Cinematographer sparked the bug and interest upon the first moments of being on set. Soon after he learned the trades of becoming a Grip and Electric, and joined the Massachusetts chapter of the Motion Picture Union (IATSE Local 481).  </p>

				<p class="text-black"> After a few years of being a studio technician, Tommy applied and was enrolled to The American Film Institute in Hollywood, CA, where he received his MFA in Cinematography. Post graduation he went on to become a Gaffer on countless music videos and national commercials for such clients as Ford, AllState, HBO and many others, before becoming a Cinematographer in his own right. Due to his working relationship as a Gaffer, opportunities were given to make the transition into Director Of Photography by such people as Spike Lee.  </p>

				<p class="text-black"> In the past five to six years as a D.O.P, Tommy “Maddox”-Upshaw has been given opportunities to lens projects for studios such Sony Screen Gems, Marvel, and Fox Search Light to name a few. Tommy is a cameraman who always aims to collaborate with a Director to bring their vision to light, and to create memorable cinema or moments onscreen.  </p>

				<h3 class="text-primary"> PRODUCTION NOTES </h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="text-black"> "Roubado" (pronounced "Who-Bah-Du", and is portuguese for "stolen") tells the story of Alain Castelo, an introverted Afro-Portuguese teen growing up in the south of France. As he suffers his parents' recent breakup, the only solace he can muster is his penchant for photography. When his mother's new live-in boyfriend crosses the line, Alain's eyes are opened to the world and he can no longer hide behind the viewfinder of his vintage camera. </p>

				<p class="text-black"> I was first inspired to tell this story when I formed an unlikely friendship with a 16 year old photographer on the streets of Cannes, France over three years ago. I traveled to France to attend the Cannes Film Festival (which I have attended for five consecutive years with films featured in the Short Film Corner and as a participant of the Marche du Film"). I crossed paths with the teen photographer, as I navigated through the city. He did not speak a word of English, but requested to take my photograph. Since our fateful encounter, we have maintained communication. The more that I have learned about his life, the more I realized how his existence as a Black male youth in France parallels that of the American teen experience. </p>

				<p class="text-black"> Although the story is not biographical, my relationship with the teen inspired the film's protagonist, who became my vehicle for sharing the black experience with the world. </p>

				<p class="text-black"> "Roubado" is my graduate thesis film for USC's School of Cinematic Arts, which I am a recent graduate of. The film was awarded the Panavision New Filmmaker Grant, which allowed me to shoot on 35mm film equipment. Funds for the film were raised through a Kickstarter campaign, which was 111% funded. </p>

				<p class="text-black"> Principal photography began in Los Angeles in November 2013. But I traveled to Cannes with my cinematographer and lead actor the day after Christmas 2013, to shoot additional scenes for the film. There, we collaborated with four female college students, who served the roles of 1st and 2nd AC, gaffer, and Assistant Director. We received a warm reception from the City of Cannes, which allowed us to shoot free of charge. </p>

				<p class="text-black"> Other supporters of the film are Kodak, Panavision Marseille, and the Sundance Institute (who sponsored the film's scoring session).</p> 

				<p class="text-black"> The film has screened at the Writer's Guild of America, West, Pan African Film Festival, Museum of Moving Image in NYC, Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, NEWFILMMAKERS LOS ANGELES program at the AT&T Center in LA, and the Macon Film Festival. Upcoming screenings include the Black Movie Summer festival in Paris, Montreal International Black Film Festival, Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival, Black Harvest Film Festival in Chicago, and the California African American Museum. </p>

				<p class="text-black"> "Roubado" is my tribute to growing up in black skin, the loss of innocence of young men and woman, the agony of having to make adult decisions, and France, which sparked my very own coming of age. </p>
