    <p class="text-black"> Gina Kim is a filmmaker and academic. Her feature-length films and short films have garnered impressive acclaim, with screenings at prestigious film festivals such as Berlin, Venice, Locarno, Rotterdam, Vancouver, Buenos Aires, Pusan, Deau- ville and Sundance, as well as venues such as the MOMA, Centre Pompidou and the Smithsonian. Martin Scorsese has described her work as a "moving experience [in which] the performances are wonderful and touching, and the style...in- tense and very precise." Kim's most recent film, FINAL RECIPE, which stars Michelle Yeoh and Henry Lau, pre- miered at the 2013 San Sebastian Film Festival as the opening film for the Culinary Zinema section and was invited to be the opening film for the Hawaii International Film Festival. According to Film Comment, Kim has "a terrific eye, a gift for near-wordless storytelling, a knack for generating a tense glid- ing rhythm between images and sounds, shots and scenes, and for yielding a quality of radiance in her actors."  </p>

    <p class="text-black"> Between 2004-2007 and 2013-2014, Kim taught film produc- tion and theory classes at Harvard University, being the first Asian woman teaching in her department (Visual and Envi- ronmental Studies). Kim was also a member of the Jury for the 66th Venice Film Festival and the Asian Pacific Screen Awards in 2009. </p>

    <p class="text-black"> Kim currently teaches at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. </p>
